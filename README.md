# system_approximation
heuns.m is a program written in MatLab that's purpose is to numerically approximate the solutions to a system of first order homogenous differential equations of size N by N ( N being a variable number ). The equations are approximated by Heun's method.

Heun's Method explained: http://calculuslab.deltacollege.edu/ODE/7-C-2/7-C-2-h.html
